# async-cache-queue

Lightweight asynchronous task queue with cache, timeout and throttle management

[![Node.js CI](https://github.com/kawanet/async-cache-queue/workflows/Node.js%20CI/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/kawanet/async-cache-queue/actions/)
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/async-cache-queue.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/async-cache-queue)

## SYNOPSIS

```js
const {queueFactory, clearCache} = require("async-cache-queue");
const axios = require("axios");

const memoize = queueFactory({
    cache: 3600000, // 1 hour for results resolved
    refresh: 60000, // 1 min for pre-fetching next
    negativeCache: 1000, // 1 sec for errors rejected
    timeout: 10000, // 10 sec for force cancelation
    maxItems: 1000, // 1000 items in memory cache
    concurrency: 10, // 10 process throttled
});

const cacheGET = memoize(url => axios.get(url));

async function loadAPI() {
    const {data} = await cacheGET("https://example.com/api");
    return data;
}

// clear all caches when kill -HUP signal received.
process.on("SIGHUP", clearCache);
```

## FEATURES

### Positive Caching and Throttling

Set `cache` option to enable the internal on-memory cache which stores `Promise` resolved by the given task.
Set `maxItems` option to limit the maximum number of cached items stored.
Set `concurrency` option to limit the maximum number of processes running in parallel.

```js
const memoTask = queueFactory({
    cache: 3600000, // 1 hour for results resolved
    maxItems: 1000, // 1000 items in memory cache
    concurrency: 10, // 10 process throttled
})(arg => runTask(arg));

const result = await memoTask(arg);
```

### Negative Caching and Cancellation

Set `negativeCache` to enable the internal on-memory cache which stores `Promise` rejected by the given task.
Set `timeout` to cancel the running function when its `Promise` keeps pending status for too long.
Those options work great for cases of network or system related troubles.

```js
const memoTask = queueFactory({
    negativeCache: 1000, // 1 sec for errors rejected
    timeout: 10000, // 10 sec for force cancelation
})(arg => runTask(arg));

memoTask(arg).catch(err => onFailure(err));
```

### Background Prefetching

Set longer `cache` and shorter `refresh` duration to minimize a delay to get results updated later.
It invokes pre-fetching request in background for the next coming request
if `refresh` milliseconds has past since the last result resolved.

```js
const memoTask = queueFactory({
    cache: 3600000, // 1 hour for results resolved
    refresh: 60000, // 1 min for pre-fetching next
})(arg => runTask(arg));

const val1 = await cacheGET(); // this will wait until the first result resolved.

// few seconds later
const val2 = await cacheGET(); // cached result (val2 === val1) returned without delay.

// few minutes later
const val3 = await cacheGET(); // cached result (val3 === val1) returned without delay. pre-fetching started in background.

// few seconds later
const val4 = await cacheGET(); // pre-fetched result (val4 !== val1) returned without outward delay.
```

### External Storage

Set `storage` option to enable the other external key-value storage such as
[Keyv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv).
Instead of `Promise` returned, the resolved raw value will be stored in the external storage.
Note that the cache TTL duration must be managed by the external storage.
`storage` option requires the interface of `get()` and `set()` methods implemented.

```js
const queueFactory = require("async-cache-queue").queueFactory;
const Keyv = require("keyv");
const KeyvMemcache = require("keyv-memcache");

const keyvStorage = new Keyv({
    store: new KeyvMemcache("localhost:11211"),
    namespace: "prefix:",
    ttl: 3600000, // 1 hour
});

const memoTask = queueFactory({
    storage: keyvStorage,
    negativeCache: 1000, // 1 sec for errors rejected
    timeout: 10000, // 10 sec for force cancelation
    concurrency: 10, // 10 process throttled
})(arg => runTask(arg));
```

### Global Erasure

Call `clearCache()` method to clear all internal caches managed by the module by a single call.
Note that it doesn't affect to external caches managed by `storage`.

```js
const clearCache = require("async-cache-queue").clearCache;

// clear all caches when kill -HUP signal received.
process.on("SIGHUP", clearCache);
```
